| Module ID | Module Label | Latest version |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
| gg-faw | Fighters & Warlords | 2.0.1 |


## Module Installation

Note: The Fantasy Add-on modules for Foundry do not use the Premium Content system by Foundry. So, the modules can't be auto-discovered or installed by Foundry. You have to unzip by yourself in your installation.
After you bought the module from Drivethru, you should be able to download a zip file. The zip name references the module (e.g. gg-faw for Fighter & Warlords) and the version (e.g. 2.0.0).

Do **not** forget to activate the module in your world after you installed it.

### Requirements

* FoundryVTT version 11
* SWADE system version 3.2.0 or higher
* (optional) SWADE Core Ruleset Premium Module 3.2.0 or higher
* (optional) SWADE Fantasy Companion 1.1.0 or higher

The premimum modules are optional. If you don't have them, the Fantasy Add-ons modules won't break.
However, some descriptions in Edges and Journals of the Fantasy Add-ons modules have links to contents from the Premium modules.

### Local Installation

* Go to your Foundry installation
* Find your UserData directory
* Get into UserData/Data/modules
* Unzip the content of the zip directly into this folder
*   e.g. if you install gg-faw-2.0.0.zip, you should end up with UserData/Data/modules/gg-faw, inside which you can directly find module.json, the assets/ directory, etc.

### Installing on The Forge

If you host your Foundry games on The Forge (or similar provider which usually installs modules for you direclty from Foundry), you'll have to use some custom importer to install your module. 

* Log into your [TheForge](https://forge-vtt.com/) account
* Open the menu _My Foundry > Games Configuration_
* In _Table Tools_ click _Summon Import Wizard_
* Choose the option to upload a _Zip File_
* Browse for the module's zip (or drag & drop it)
* Hit _Analyze File_
* TheForge should tell you one module was found
* Tick the option _Do not install from the Bazaar and import this package as a custom package_ then hit _Import All_
* Once _1 module was imported_ and everything is green, hit _Finish_ and _Close_
* Now launch your game world, then activate the module for that world

## How to use the modules?

Each module comes with a Journal entry "Using _addonname_ in Foundry VTT". It gives you details where you'll find the rules, edges, powers, or other specificities offered by the module.

If there is anything you don't understand, find us, Joseph and Cyril, on the official Foundry Discord in the [SWADE channel](https://discord.com/channels/170995199584108546/715780900322803753).
We have a dedicated channel [#Fantasy Add-ons](https://discord.com/channels/170995199584108546/1160532496501461162) there you can use for questions specific to the Fantasy Add-ons modules.

If you have questions about the Add-ons, which are not related to FoundryVTT (e.g. what an Edge exactly does, or whether two effects stacks the way you think), join [Gronyon Games Discord](https://discord.gg/YQERjfzwUB).
