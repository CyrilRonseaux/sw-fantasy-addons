## How to use the modules?

Each module comes with a Journal entry "Using _addonname_ in Foundry VTT". It gives you details where you'll find the rules, edges, powers, or other specificities offered by the module.

If there is anything you don't understand, find us, Joseph and Cyril, on the official Foundry Discord in the [SWADE channel](https://discord.com/channels/170995199584108546/715780900322803753).
We have a dedicated channel [#Fantasy Add-ons](https://discord.com/channels/170995199584108546/1160532496501461162) there you can use for questions specific to the Fantasy Add-ons modules.

If you have questions about the Add-ons, which are not related to FoundryVTT (e.g. what an Edge exactly does, or whether two effects stacks the way you think), join [Gronyon Games Discord](https://discord.gg/YQERjfzwUB).
